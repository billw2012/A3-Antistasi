Can only move HQ items once.
Once you failed to place an item (bought vehicle, garage item), from then on the items you place will not show up (perhaps when you place item n, item n-1 will show up?)
Often can't load supply crate easily, need to move vehicle all over the place, bump the crate etc.
Auto rearmers can get stuck in rearm pose frozen.
Sometimes revived units are stuck lying down unable to move even though revived.
